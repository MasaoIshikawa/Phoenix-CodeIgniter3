subcontractors, employees, and distributors thereof.</p>

<h4>2. ACCEPTANCE BY BUYER; PURCHASE CONTRACT</h4> 
<p>Upon placing an order with Seller by phone, email, or online, this Purchase Contract is hereby accepted on the terms set forth 
herein. Terms in any form which are in addition to or not identical with these Terms will not become a part of any Purchase Contract 
unless Seller specifically and expressly agrees in writing that such other terms are accepted. By performing under this Purchase 
Contract or any part hereof, Buyer agrees to and accepts all the provisions of the Purchase Contract and agrees to fully perform. 
The rights and duties of the both Parties shall be subject to and governed by these Terms.</p>

<h4>3. ACCEPTANCE BY BUYER; PAYMENT</h4> 
<p>Buyer shall transmit payment to Seller within thirty (30) days from acceptance of a proper invoice, e.g., one submitted pursuant to a 
valid purchase order. Buyer shall have a reasonable time (but not more than 30 days) after receipt to inspect the goods tendered by 
Seller. If Buyer suspects any nonconforming goods, Buyer must contact Seller and receive written authorization from Seller before 
rejecting any goods and/or services tendered or deducting any payment.</p>

<p>Seller reserves the right to refuse return on any radioactive products, custom-made products, or temperature-sensitive assay kits.

<p>A 1.5% service charge per month and an 18% service charge per annum will be applied to all past-due invoices.</p>

<h4>4. RISK OF LOSS </h4>
<p>Buyer shall bear all risk of loss and damage, unless such loss or damage results solely from the active negligence or intentional 
misconduct of Seller.</p>

<h4>5. SALES AND OTHER TAXES</h4> 
<p>Unless otherwise specified herein, Buyer agrees that additional federal, state, local use, excise, transaction, or other taxes, fees, and/or
assessments may be added to the total price.</p>

<h4>6. EXCUSE </h4>
<p>Buyer shall be excused for any nonperformance due principally to circumstances which are both beyond its control and not foreseeable,

Buyer, any subcontractor of either, any carrier, or any other person.</p>

<h4>7. NOTICE OF LABOR DISPUTES </h4>

Buyer in writing, presenting all relevant information concerning the dispute and its background.</p>

<h4>8. WARRANTY </h4>
<p>Seller warrants that its products are of the stated quality at the time of shipment. Should a quality problem arise, the sole obligation of 
Seller is to replace the products at their original purchase price. This applies only to products in their original packaging. This does not
 apply to (a) products that have been tampered with or altered in any way or (b) products that have been misused or damaged by 
accident or through negligence. Buyer assumes all responsibility for the use and handling of these products, including any liability for 
consequential, special, indirect, or incidental damage resulting from their use. Buyer assumes all responsibility for determining the 
existence of such patents and whether their use of the material would constitute an infringement on these patents.</p>

<h4>9. CHANGE OR CANCELLATION FOR CONVENIENCE</h4> 
<p>Seller, by written notice, may change or terminate all or any part of this Purchase Contract for Seller’s convenience. If such a change 
results in an increase or decrease in costs to be incurred or time needed to complete performance of this Purchase Contract, then 
Buyer and Seller will make a fair and equitable modification of their rights and obligations under this agreement.</p>
 
<h4>10. APPLICABLE LAW, ETC.</h4> 
<p>This Purchase Contract and the performance hereunder shall be construed according to the law of California as applied to contracts 
made and performed within California. The parties hereto agree that any dispute arising under this Purchase Contract shall be resolved
 in the courts of San Mateo County or in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California, Northern Branch, and Buyer 
and Seller hereby submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of said courts. All rights and remedies of Buyer and Seller shall be 
cumulative.</p>

<h4>11. ACCESS TO RECORDS </h4>
<p>Seller shall have access to and the right to examine any directly relevant books, documents, papers, and records of Buyer involving 
transactions related to this Purchase Order until the expiration of three (3) years after final payment hereunder. Buyer agrees to keep 
and maintain such records for such period of time. If this agreement is for the provision of services with a value of $10,000 or more 
within a 12-month period, then until the expiration of four (4) years after the furnishing of any services pursuant to this agreement, 
Buyer shall make available, upon written request from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or from the 
U.S. Comptroller, such books, documents and records of Seller as are necessary to certify the nature and extent of the reasonable cost
of services to Seller. If Buyer enters into an agreement with any related organization to provide services pursuant to this agreement 
with a value of $10,000 or more within a 12-month period, such agreement shall contain a clause identical in content to the first 
sentence of this paragraph. This paragraph shall be of force and effect only to the extent required by P.L. 96-449.</p>

performing as specified.</p>

constitute an infringement of these patents.</p>

<h4>14. EFFECTIVE DATE</h4> 
<p>The effective dates of this Purchase Contract shall be as stated on the individual Order Confirmation supplied by Seller.</p>

<h4>15. COMPLETE AGREEMENT</h4>
